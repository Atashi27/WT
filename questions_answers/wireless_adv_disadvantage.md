# Explain in detail Advantages and Disadvantages of wireless communication


#### Advantages 

* **Ease of Use :**  Main advantage of a wireless network over a wired one is that users can move around freely within the area of the network with their laptops, handheld devices etc and get an internet connection.

* **Adding new device is easy :** Not having to lay lots of cables and put them through walls etc. can be a considerable advantage in terms of time and expense. It also makes it easier to add extra devices to the network, as no new cabling is needed.

* **Maintenance** and installation is less cost for these networks.

* **Scalability** Expanding a wired network can be costly and difficult with adding new cables and rerouting the existing ones. But expansion with wireless is pretty easy. A new user can be added by issuing a password and updating it in the server.



#### Disadvantages

* **Range:**  The range of a wireless network is limited and a typical wireless router will only allow individuals within 150 to 300 feet to access the network

* **Interference:** Wireless networks are extremely susceptible to interference so radio signals, radiation and any other similar type of interference may cause a wireless network to malfunction.

* **Security:** Wireless networks can be accessed by any computer within range of the network's signal so information transmitted through the network (including encrypted information) may be intercepted by unauthorized users

* **Speed :** Wireless networks are typically slower than wired networks, sometimes even up to 10 times slower.
