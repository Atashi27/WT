# Factors of change in economics of wireless technology 

#### 1. Current State of wireless technology

* Mobile wireless communications is currently one of the fastest growing segments of the telecommunications industry.

* Wireless Internet is having a significant impact on the world of mobile wireless networks.

* Mobile terminals are expected to experience a increase in sales increase in future

* The mobile carriers will facing the greatest market challenges in the new era of the wireless industry. They must adapt to the reducing growth rates of the subscriber base and the declining prices

* Wireless bandwidth is a scarce and expensive resource it is difficult to win the price war between the ISP internet and Mobile wireless internet. Wired internet will be always fast and cheap.

* Mobile carriers run their own or tie up with the content providers example music or video on demand for mobile users. 

* A number of capacity-demanding data applications are already available in the mobile phones like video calls, music and video on demand etc.

#### 2. Charging Issues 

* Issue regarding the charges of the call originated or terminiated to mobile in home or foreign network is no more now. All incoming calls are free in all the  areas. Earlier it was like _calling party_ pays or _receiving party_ used to pay.

#### 3. Charging Methods 

* **Packet Charging :** In this method charging is based on the amount of data usage.

* **Expected Capacity Charging:** In this method data gureenteed data speed was fixed on some charge

* **Paris-Metro Charging** :  In this method, the network provides different traffic classes, with each class being characterized by different capabilities (such as capacity) and hence a different charge.

* **Content-based Charging:**  A different approach to the problem of how to charge a customer for utilizing the network is content-based charging. The novelty of this approach is that users are not charged based on usage but rather on the type of content they access.  This type of charging is not popular.
